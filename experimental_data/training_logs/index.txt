2018_06_27_first_training_run.out: The very first time I trained a neural network on the supercomputer. It was a simple multi-layer neural network trained on the banded Fourier transformed data without AP cuts. It was just a proof of concept.
2018_06_28_first_image_classification.out: A convolutional neural network was trained to distinguish between images from the background run and the americium-beryllium calibration run. Validation data did not work. An unexpected success at ~96% accuracy on the training set; however, I was wary of overfitting because of the very large number of parameters in the first dense layer.
2018_06_28_second_image_classification.out: Very similar to the previous experiment. However, the proportion of bubbles randomly omitted was reduced from 0.8 to 0.5. Also, the number of images held in memory was increased from 256 to 512, and the number of images turned over per batch was increased from 2 to 16, resulting in a greater exposure to different training examples. I added another convolutional layer to reduce the number of parameters in the network. Despite this, it managed to obtain ~97% accuracy on the training set.
