% A description of the various techniques used to discriminate between neutrons and alphas
\section{Methods}

Two key techniques have been used for the task of discrimination between neutrons/WIMP candidates and alpha particles in the PICO-60 bubble chamber. The first, Acoustic Parameter (AP), is a function of the 8-band Fourier transform \textbeta \textsubscript{8}. It makes use of the increased resonant energy in certain frequency bands, relative to neutrons, present in the majority of alpha particles. The second, Deep Learning (DL) consists of a wide variety of neural networks, which are trained on either the raw waveform \textomega{}, the arbitrary-resolution Fourier transform \textbeta \textsubscript{N}, or the image \textiota.
