# Machine Learning for Dark Matter Detection
This is my 2018-2019 science fair project. My primary objective is to devise original applications of machine learning for WIMP dark matter candidate detection.

## Technologies
This repository contains Python 3 code. NumPy, SciPy, scikit-image, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Keras, and PyROOT are used. To execute scripts, first add the root folder of this repository to your `$PYTHONPATH`.
